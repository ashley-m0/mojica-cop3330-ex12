Exercise 12 - Computing Simple Interest
Computing simple interest is a great way to quickly figure out whether an investment has value. Itâ€™s
also a good way to get comfortable with explicitly coding the order of operations in your programs.

Create a program that computes simple interest. Prompt for the principal amount, the rate as a percentage,
and the time, and display the amount accrued (principal + interest).

The formula for simple interest is A = P(1 + rt), where P is the principal amount, r is the annual rate of
interest, t is the number of years the amount is invested, and A is the amount at the end of the investment.

Example Output:
Enter the principal: 1500
Enter the rate of interest: 4.3
Enter the number of years: 4
After 4 years at 4.3%, the investment will be worth $1758.

Constraints:
Prompt for the rate as a percentage (like 15, not .15). Divide the input by 100 in your program.
Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the next penny.
Ensure that the output is formatted as money.

Challenges:
-Ensure that the values entered for principal, rate, and number of years are numeric and that the program
 will not let the user proceed without valid inputs.
-Alter the program to use a function called calculateSimpleInterest that takes in the rate, principal, and
 number of years and returns the amount at the end of the investment.
-In addition to printing out the final amount, print out the amount at the end of each year.
